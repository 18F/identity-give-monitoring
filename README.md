# IDVA Monitoring Service
Monitoring for IDVA microservices in cloud.gov

## Why this project
The IDVA project is composed of many different microservices, each needing to
be monitored for performance, stability, and uptime. The monitoring
microservice has the following goals:
* Provide monitoring capabilities for IDVA microservices
* Alert IDVA operators/admins on specified metric thresholds

## Architecture Overview
![architecture-diagram](.github/monitoring-architecture.svg)

## Implementation
IDVA monitoring is a set of monitoring tools that get deployed together to enable
monitoring of the IDVA system. The repo is broken down by tool and contains:
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): an HA Prometheus setup to monitor applications based on DNS querying of the application routes. 
  * For all applications we wish to monitor, adding a `dns_sd_config` within the [prometheus-config.yml](prometheus/prometheus-config.yml) adds
  the application to prometheus's monitoring. By using the `dns_sd_config` we are able to see and query **all** instances of the application,
  and are not load balanced to random instances every query.
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/): A simple dashboard setup to view some of the IDVA metrics in real-time
* [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/): an HA Alertmanager cluster that handles alert deduplication and routing.
* [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/): A single-binary-mode Cortex instance for shipping metrics to S3 for long-term storage.
* [Watchtower](https://github.com/18F/watchtower): A run-anywhere, Cloud Foundry drift detection service (designed to be scraped by Prometheus).
* [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/): Basic Kibana setup for quickly querying elasticsearch data in cloud.gov
* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter/): A Prometheus exporter for Elasticsearch metrics on cloud.gov
* [Redis](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter/): A Prometheus Exporter for Redis metrics on cloud.gov

## Generating the config files
The config files are generic to prevent having to have multiple configuration files
per space (dev, test, prod, etc). The <tool-name>-config.yml files are intended to be
fed to `envsubst` after the appropriate environment variable has been set. The config
should be output to the appropriate named files (see examples below).
```shell
# Examples of config file generation using envsubst
envsubst < prometheus/prometheus-config.yml > prometheus/prometheus.yml
envsubst < alertmanager/alert-config.yml > alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```
